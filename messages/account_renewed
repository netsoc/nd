Subject: Netsoc account "%(username)s" has been renewed

Your Netsoc account, %(username)s, has been renewed for this year. 

You can log into our servers Spoon and Cube by SSH or via the Netsoc
website. Cube also supports graphical login via NX (download a client
at http://nomachine.com), but is currently only accessible from inside
college.

You can use your webspace on Cube by logging in via SSH (download PuTTY
from http://netsoc.tcd.ie and log into cube.netsoc.tcd.ie) and running
"setup_webspace".

For those of you who still have websites running on Matrix (our old
server), you should know that Netsoc will be decomissioning Matrix soon.
When this happens, websites will be moved to Cube. If you would like to
use Cube for webhosting before then, please mail support@netsoc.tcd.ie
and we'll set it up.

If you've forgotten your password, or have any trouble logging in,
please contact support@netsoc.tcd.ie.
